I think it would be helpful to have objectives outlined for major sections of
curriculum, That would give a help give shape to a course outline. I'll start
the brainstorming and hopefully it will grow from there.

## Section 1 rought outline and objectives - Ruby basics

1. Hello World using an online REPL such as repl.it

- Objective: Get a taste of programming Ruby

2. Installing Ruby

- Objective: Have Ruby running:
- On Windows OR
- On Mac OR
- On Linux

3. Hello World on your own computer using IRB

- Run through the same scenario as lesson 1 but on your own computer

4. Hello World using `ruby main.rb`

- Run through the same scenario as 1 & 2 but using a ruby file

5. Basic data types `String` and `Integer`

- Introduction to basic data types
- perform some simple methods using the data types
- Use REPL

6. Local Variables

- Storing strings and integers in variables in repls
- Storing strings and integers in variables in a Ruby file

7. Exercise: Madlibs

- Using `gets.chomp` & `puts` to make a simple application.
- Learn about string interpolation
- Find a madlib on the internet
- save all blank spaces as variables
- run the program that out puts the madlib

8. Loops

- Learn about loops (I think iterators is a difficult concept to understand as a newcomer)
- perform some simple loop operations using a Ruby file

9. Arithmetic in IRB

- Learn about the `-`, `+`, `/`, and `*` operators using IRB

10. Exercise - Make a calculator CLI program

- create a simple Ruby program that runs user inputted math operations

11. Arrays & Hashes

- Learn about different types of data storage.

12. Methods

- By now we should have learned about some methods for each basic data type
- Write our own methods and run them with the Ruby command

13. Exercise - Make a simple game (war, tic-tac-toe, go fish)

- Utilize all skills learned so far to create a game
- Use methods & arrays to keep track of game state
- Use a begin/end loop to create a game engine

14. Exercise - Make a more complex game (game of life, blackjack)

- Build on skills practiced in 13 to perform more complex operations.

## Section 2 outline - Classes and Objects

## Section 3 outline - Web Basics (Sinatra?)

## Section 4 outline - Build a simple web app (Sinatra?)
